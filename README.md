### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

It's the right place to be if:
- You're looking for my Qt utilities: QML libraries, Qt tools, etc.
- You're looking for my contributions to open-source projects that are on GitHub.

Beware that not everything I do is here. There is also lots of stuff on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/oclero/).

If you're looking for Solarus repositories, it's on the offcial [Solarus GitLab](https://gitlab.com/solarus-games/).
