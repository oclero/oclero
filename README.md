## Hello 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

It's the right place to be if:
- 🎨 You're looking for my **Qt utilities**: QML libraries, Qt tools, etc.
- 🔧 You're looking for my **other various programming projects**.
- 🤝 You're looking for my **contributions to open-source projects** that are on GitHub.

> [!note]
> Beware that not everything I do is here. There is also some stuff on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/oclero/).

### Solarus
